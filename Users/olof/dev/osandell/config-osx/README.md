This folder is part of the bare git repository ".config-system-specific" for OSX.

I use it to store all files that are part of the system config and that are unique for OSX. All the common files like the git config, bash aliases etc. are stored in the ".config-shared" repository.

This folder, (where this readme file resides), is used to store files that are not actively part of the system, but that are needed when setting up a new system.
